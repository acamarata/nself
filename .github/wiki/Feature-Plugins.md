# Feature: Plugins

The ɳSelf plugin system extends your stack with additional services, API routes, and capabilities, without writing infrastructure code.

## How Plugins Work

A plugin is a manifest + Docker Compose overlay + optional Nginx config. When you install and build:

1. `nself plugin install <name>`, downloads and caches the plugin
2. `nself build`, merges the plugin's compose overlay into `docker-compose.yml` and injects Nginx routes
3. `nself start` / `nself restart`, runs the updated stack
