## What Is ɳFamily

ɳFamily is the marketing name for the bundle of plugins that powers a private family social platform: shared photo timelines, activity feeds, group chat, and a moderated content layer. It is not a repo or a single plugin. The frontend client is planned (TBD).

When the bundle is installed, your ɳSelf backend gains social posts, photo storage and timelines, an activity feed engine, real-time updates, a CMS layer for shared family content, group chat, and moderation tools.

## Plugins Included

7 pro plugins, all `tier: pro` (Basic tier or higher).

| Plugin | Tier | Language | What It Does |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| [social](plugin-social) | pro | Go | Posts, comments, reactions, follows |
| [photos](plugin-photos) | pro | Go | Photo upload, albums, sharing, EXIF metadata |
| [activity-feed](plugin-activity-feed) | pro | Go | Personalized activity timeline with fan-out |
| [moderation](plugin-moderation) | pro | Go | Auto-moderation, word filters, user reports |
| [realtime](plugin-realtime) | pro | Go | WebSocket presence, live updates |
| [cms](plugin-cms) | pro | Go | Shared content (announcements, events, recipes) |
| [chat](plugin-chat) | pro | Go | Channels, DMs, threads (shared with ɳChat bundle) |

`moderation`, `realtime`, and `chat` are also part of the [ɳChat bundle](bundle-nchat), install once, used by both.

## How They Work Together

```
Family member posts → social → activity-feed → realtime → other family members
                          ↓
                       photos (media)
                          ↓
                     moderation (safety)
                          ↓
                       chat (group conversations)
                          ↓
                       cms (shared content: events, recipes, news)
```

### Sharing

1. **social** stores posts, comments, reactions, and the follow graph
2. **photos** handles uploads, generates thumbnails, organizes albums, indexes EXIF metadata
3. **cms** stores shared family content (event calendar, recipes, family news)

### Distribution

1. **activity-feed** maintains a per-user timeline by fanning out post events to followers' feeds
2. **realtime** delivers live updates over WebSocket so feeds refresh without reload

### Conversation

1. **chat** runs channels, DMs, and threads for family group chat
2. **moderation** scans content for banned words and rate-abuse, supports manual reports

## Installation

```bash
# Basic tier or higher (all nFamily plugins are tier: pro)
nself license set nself_pro_xxxxx...
nself plugin install social photos activity-feed moderation realtime cms chat

# Rebuild and start
nself build && nself start
```

Basic tier is $0.99/mo or $9.99/yr. See [Plugin-Licensing](Plugin-Licensing) for the tier comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ɳSelf CLI installed and a project initialized (`nself init`)
- Backend running (`nself start`)
- Basic tier license key or higher
- Object storage (MinIO ships with the ɳSelf stack) for `photos`

### Step 1: Install the plugins

Install all 7 ɳFamily plugins with the command above.

### Step 2: Configure storage and limits

Edit your `.env` to set photo upload size limits and album quota. See [plugin-photos](plugin-photos).

### Step 3: Configure moderation

Set word lists, rate limits, and report routing. See [plugin-moderation](plugin-moderation).

### Step 4: Build a client

The official ɳFamily frontend is planned. Until then, the plugin APIs (REST and GraphQL via Hasura) are documented on each plugin page and can drive a custom Next.js or Flutter client.

### Troubleshooting

- **Photo uploads fail:** check MinIO credentials and bucket policy
- **Feed not updating live:** verify `realtime` WebSocket is reachable and JWT auth is configured
- **Moderation false positives:** tune `moderation` word lists per group
