# Licensing Guide

This page covers the full ɳSelf licensing model: the free core, per-product plugin bundles, the ɳSelf+ all-access subscription, key management, and upgrade/downgrade behavior.

---

## The Free Core

The ɳSelf CLI and 29 free plugins are MIT licensed. Free forever, including commercial use. No license key needed.

Free plugins include: backup, content-acquisition, content-progress, cron, donorbox, feature-flags, github, github-runner, invitations, jobs, link-preview, mdns, mlflow, monitoring, notifications, notify, paypal, search, shopify, stripe, subtitle-manager, tokens, torrent-manager, vpn, webhooks.

You can run a full production stack (Postgres, Hasura, Auth, Nginx, monitoring, backups, search) without paying anything.

---

## Pro Plugins (62 total)

Pro plugins are source-available Rust binaries distributed through the ɳSelf plugin system. They require a valid license key.

### Per-Bundle Pricing

| Option | Monthly | Annual | What You Get |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | Core CLI + 29 free plugins |
| **Any single bundle** | $0.99/mo | $9.99/yr | All plugins in that bundle (ɳClaw, ɳChat, ɳTV, ɳFamily, or ClawDE) |
| **ɳSelf+** | $3.99/mo | $39.99/yr | All 5 bundles + all apps + support |

Annual gives roughly 16% savings versus monthly (about 2 months free).

## Per-Product Plugin Bundles

Each ɳSelf product has a recommended plugin bundle. Bundles are not separate SKUs. They are a way to understand which plugins power each product. All plugins are available at the Basic tier and above.

### ɳClaw Bundle

| mux | Email pipeline (Gmail, rules, auto-reply) |
| voice | TTS, STT, phone calls |
| browser | Web scraping and automation |
| google | Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets |
| notify | Telegram and webhook notifications |

---

## ɳSelf+ ($3.99/mo or $39.99/yr)

The all-access subscription. Includes every plugin bundle, every product, and support via chat.nself.org or the ɳChat app. One key unlocks the entire ecosystem.

ɳSelf+ costs less than buying individual bundles if you use three or more products.

---

## Key Management

### Setting Your Key

```bash
nself license set nself_pro_xxxxx...
```

The key is stored at `~/.nself/license/key` with chmod 600. It is also read from the `NSELF_PLUGIN_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.

### Checking Status

```bash
nself license status
```

Shows your current tier, expiry date, and which plugin categories you can install.

### Removing Your Key

```bash
nself license remove
```

### Key Format

Keys use a prefix format:

| Prefix | Tier |
|--------|------|
| `nself_pro_` | Pro tier and above |
| `nself_max_` | Pro tier |
| `nself_ent_` | Enterprise tier |
| `nself_owner_` | Owner/internal tier |

Keys must be at least 32 characters total.

---

## License Validation

Tier entitlement is checked server-side. The CLI never makes tier decisions locally.

```
POST https://ping.nself.org/license/validate
{"license_key": "...", "product": "plugins-pro"}
```

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 200 | Valid key, plugin allowed |
| 401/403/404 | Invalid key or insufficient tier |

Validation results are cached locally for 24 hours at `~/.nself/license/cache`.

### Runtime Revalidation

Installed plugins revalidate on a 7-day cycle via libnclaw. If the network is down, a grace period allows continued operation. A Telegram alert fires on key expiry. Force revalidation:

```bash
nself license revalidate
```

### Offline Mode

For air-gapped environments:

```bash
NSELF_LICENSE_SKIP_VERIFY=1 nself plugin install {name}
```

---

## Upgrading and Downgrading

### Upgrade
1. Purchase a higher tier at nself.org/pricing.
2. Run `nself license set {new-key}`.
3. Install newly available plugins: `nself plugin install ai claw mux ...`
4. Rebuild: `nself build && nself start`.

Stripe handles proration automatically. You pay the difference for the remainder of your billing cycle.

### Downgrade
1. Change your tier in the Stripe customer portal (cloud.nself.org/license).
2. Plugins above your new tier stop working at the next revalidation cycle (up to 7 days).
3. The CLI does not forcibly remove plugins, but they will fail health checks and be excluded from the tool registry.

### Cancellation
1. Cancel via the Stripe portal.
2. Free plugins continue working indefinitely.
3. Pro plugins stop working at next revalidation.
4. Your data is never deleted. You still have full access to your database and files.

---

## Stripe Integration

All payment processing goes through Stripe:

- Checkout at nself.org/pricing creates a Stripe subscription.
- Webhook at ping.nself.org handles subscription lifecycle events.
- Customer portal at cloud.nself.org/license for self-service billing management.
- Invoices accessible in the portal.
