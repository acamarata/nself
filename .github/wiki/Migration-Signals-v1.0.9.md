# Migration Signals: v1.0.8 to v1.0.9

This page documents every signal that could affect users upgrading from v1.0.8 to v1.0.9 LTS.

For users upgrading from v0.9, see [[Upgrade-From-v0.9]] first, then return here.

---

## Summary

v1.0.9 is a **non-breaking LTS release**. No CLI commands were renamed or removed.
No env vars were deleted. All 47 commands remain stable.

This page documents the audit explicitly so the absence of migration signals is itself a documented finding.

## Detail

### Plugin SDK rename (plugin authors only)

If you author a custom plugin using the old `nself_plugin_sdk` Go package, update your `go.mod`:

```bash
# Remove old dependency
go get github.com/nself-org/nself_plugin_sdk@none

# Add new SDK
go get github.com/nself-org/plugin-sdk-go@v0.1.0
go mod vendor
```

Update imports in your plugin source:

```go
// Before (v1.0.8)
import "github.com/nself-org/nself_plugin_sdk"

// After (v1.0.9+)
import sdk "github.com/nself-org/plugin-sdk-go"
```

### nMedia bundle renamed to nTV

Users who installed the `nMedia` bundle should reinstall using the new name:

```bash
nself plugin uninstall nMedia   # if installed by bundle slug
nself plugin install nTV        # reinstall under new name
```

The underlying plugins (media-processing, streaming, epg, tmdb, podcast, recording,
game-metadata, file-processing, subtitle-manager, vpn) are unchanged.

### nself_sessions.user_agent deprecation (Hasura / GraphQL only)

This only affects consumers querying Hasura directly. If your code selects `user_agent`:

```graphql
# Before
query { nself_sessions { user_agent } }

# After (v1.0.9+)
query { nself_sessions { device_type device_name } }
```

The `user_agent` column returns data through 2027-04-17 (LTS window) then is removed in v1.2.0.
