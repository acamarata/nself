# Guide: Backup and Restore

Protect your data with regular, tested backups.

## Automated Backups (Recommended)

Install the backup plugin for scheduled, automated backups:

```bash
nself plugin install backup
nself build && nself restart
```

Configure schedule and retention in `.env`:

```env
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=0 2 * * *          # daily at 2am
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30           # keep 30 days
BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=my-backup-bucket  # optional: upload to S3/MinIO
```

## Manual Database Backup

```bash
nself db dump
```

Writes a pg_dump file to `.nself/backups/` with a timestamped filename.

## Backup to S3 / MinIO

Configure in `.env` (or `.env.secrets`):

```env
BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=my-backups
BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret>
```

Compatible with AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and any S3-compatible provider.

## Restore from Backup

```bash
nself db restore .nself/backups/myproject_20260328_020000.sql
```

The restore command:
1. Stops application services (keeps Postgres running)
2. Drops and recreates the target database
3. Restores from the dump file
4. Restarts services

> **Important:** Test your restores regularly. Untested backups are not backups.

## Backup Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backup job runs successfully (check logs: `nself logs backup`)
- [ ] Backup files appear in `.nself/backups/` or S3 bucket
- [ ] Restoration test succeeds on a staging instance
- [ ] Retention policy removes old files as expected
