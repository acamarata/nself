## How Plugins Work

Plugins inject into your ɳSelf stack via Docker Compose overlays. When you run `nself build`, all installed plugins are merged into a single `docker-compose.yml`. Each plugin:

- Runs as its own container(s) on a dedicated port
- Gets its own Postgres schema (`np_{name}`) with isolated tables
- Injects nginx routes automatically
- Declares environment variables in `plugin.json`

After installing any plugin, run `nself build` to regenerate your compose file.

## Plugin Bundles

Bundles group plugins that work together to deliver a complete feature set. Per F06-BUNDLE-INVENTORY, the canonical bundles are:

| Bundle | Price | Plugins | Use Case |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| [[bundle-nclaw]] | $0.99/mo | ai, claw, claw-web, mux, voice, browser, google, notify, cron, claw-budget, claw-news | AI personal assistant: email, calendar, news, budget, tools |
| [[bundle-clawde]] | $1.99/mo / $19.99/yr | TBD (cloud sync, premium models, team features) | ClawDE+ remote/mobile sync via API |
| [[bundle-nmedia]] | $0.99/mo | media-processing, streaming, epg, tmdb, stream-gateway, podcast (+ free torrent-manager, content-acquisition) | Self-hosted media acquisition, processing, and streaming |
| [[bundle-nfamily]] | $0.99/mo | social, photos, activity-feed, moderation, realtime, cms, chat | Private family social, photo sharing, activity feeds |
| [[bundle-nchat]] | $0.99/mo | chat, livekit, recording, moderation, bots, realtime, auth | Messaging with video calls, bots, and moderation |

Or get all bundles + all apps via **ɳSelf+** ($49.99/yr).
