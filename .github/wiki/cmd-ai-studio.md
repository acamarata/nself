## This command moved

`ai-studio` was extracted from the core binary into the `ai-studio` plugin as
part of [CLI-R11](https://github.com/nself-org/cli/blob/main/.claude) (the
thin-core extraction). The command surface is unchanged — only where the code
lives changed.

```bash
nself install ai-studio
nself ai-studio bridge
```

Until it is installed, `nself ai-studio ...` prints an install hint pointing
here. Full documentation (flags, exit codes, examples) now lives with the
plugin: https://github.com/nself-org/plugins/tree/main/free/ai-studio
