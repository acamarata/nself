# nself federation

<!-- BEGIN PROSE:summary -->
> Moved to a plugin (CLI-R11). Install it to keep using `nself federation`.
<!-- END PROSE:summary -->

## This command moved

`federation` was extracted from the core binary into the `federation` plugin
as part of [CLI-R11](https://github.com/nself-org/cli/blob/main/.claude) (the
thin-core extraction). The command surface is unchanged — only where the
code lives changed.

```bash
nself install federation
nself federation compose
nself federation status
nself federation status --json
nself federation introspect
```

Until it is installed, `nself federation ...` prints an install hint
pointing here. Full documentation (subgraph configuration, flags, examples)
now lives with the plugin:
https://github.com/nself-org/plugins/tree/main/free/federation

Federation stays a free MIT plugin (no license required): it is an opt-in
architecture feature (`NSELF_FEDERATION=true`), not a licensed one.
