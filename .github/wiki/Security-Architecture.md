# Security Architecture

nSelf is designed with security as a core concern, not an afterthought. This document describes the security model and key protections built into the CLI and generated infrastructure.

## Container Security

All generated containers include hardened defaults:

```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
cap_drop:
  - ALL
```

- **`no-new-privileges`** — prevents privilege escalation via setuid binaries
- **`cap_drop: ALL`** — removes all Linux capabilities from containers by default

Nginx is the only service that retains `NET_BIND_SERVICE` (required for ports 80/443).

## Network Isolation

All internal services bind to `127.0.0.1` only. The Docker bridge network (`{project}_default`) is internal — services communicate via Docker DNS names (e.g., `hasura:8080`).

Only Nginx exposes external ports (80 and 443). All external traffic flows through Nginx, which handles TLS termination and proxying to internal services.

| Service | Binding | External Access |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| PostgreSQL | `127.0.0.1:5432` | Nginx only (not exposed) |
| Hasura | `127.0.0.1:8080` | Via Nginx proxy |
| Auth | `127.0.0.1:4000` | Via Nginx proxy |
| Nginx | `0.0.0.0:80,443` | Direct |

## Secret Management

Secrets (passwords, API keys, JWT secrets) are managed through the `.env` cascade:

- `.env.secrets` — sensitive values, **never committed to git**
- Secrets are passed to containers as environment variables, not files
- `.env.secrets` must be in `.gitignore` (verified by `nself doctor`)
- Secret values are **redacted** from all CLI output (`***REDACTED***`)

Secret env vars matching these patterns are automatically redacted:
`*_PASSWORD`, `*_SECRET`, `*_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`

## Security Headers

nSelf's Nginx configuration includes security headers on all server blocks:

```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
server_tokens off;
```

## Auth Rate Limiting

Auth endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks:

- Default: **30 requests/minute** per IP
- Burst: 5 requests
- Configurable via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` env var

## Input Sanitisation

All user inputs are validated via `internal/sanitize` before being used in generated configs:

| Input | Constraint |
|-------|-----------|
| Project name | Lowercase, 2–30 chars, alphanumeric + hyphens |
| Base domain | Valid FQDN |
| Port numbers | 1024–65535, not in reserved list |
| Custom service names | Lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores |
| Plugin versions | Anchored semver regex |
| Backup file paths | No path traversal (`../`) |

## Plugin Integrity

Plugin manifests are decoded with `DisallowUnknownFields` to prevent field injection attacks. All fields are validated after decode:
- Version strings must match anchored semver
- Plugin download URLs must use HTTPS from allowed domains
- Checksums are verified (SHA-256) before installation

## File Permissions

nSelf applies least-privilege file permissions:

| File/Dir | Permission |
|----------|-----------|
| `.env`, `.env.*` | `0600` (owner read/write only) |
| Backup directories | `0700` |
| SSL certificate directory | `0750` |
| Plugin cache files | `0600` |

## TLS

The nSelf CLI itself enforces TLS 1.2 minimum for all outbound HTTPS connections (registry, license validation, update checks). Weaker protocol versions are rejected.

## Authentication Model

nSelf uses a layered authentication system:

### JWT Authentication
The Auth service (nHost) issues JWTs on login. Tokens carry user ID, roles, and tenant claims. Hasura validates JWTs on every GraphQL request using a shared JWT secret (`HASURA_JWT_KEY`, minimum 32 characters).

Token lifecycle:
- Access tokens: short-lived (configurable, default 15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens: long-lived, stored server-side
- Token rotation: refresh tokens are single-use; each refresh issues a new refresh token

### Passkey Authentication (WebAuthn)
nClaw supports passkey-based authentication via `ASWebAuthenticationSession` on Apple platforms and WebAuthn on web. The pairing flow uses:
- Pair codes with TTL (410 Gone on expiry)
- Direct pairing via HMAC-SHA256 4-word phrases
- Pair attempt rate limiting: 10 failures per 15 minutes triggers 429 + Telegram alert
- `np_claw.pair_attempts` audit table tracks all attempts

### OAuth Providers
Auth supports 13+ OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.). OAuth tokens for AI providers (Claude, GPT-4o) are stored with AES-256-GCM encryption in the database. Token refresh happens proactively (30-minute cycle).

## Rate Limiting

### Auth Rate Limiting
Auth endpoints: 30 requests/minute per IP (burst: 5). Configurable via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`.

### Plugin Rate Limiting
- nClaw pairing: 10 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP, then 429 + Telegram alert
- AI caller tokens: per-namespace rate limiting with configurable limits per token
- Mux stall detector: exponential backoff on repeated failures (3 same-error cycles triggers stop + Telegram alert)

### Priority Queue
The AI plugin uses a 4-level priority queue for LLM requests. Higher-priority requests (user-facing chat) preempt lower-priority ones (background classification).

## ACL System

Access control operates at multiple levels:

### Hasura Permissions
Row-level security (RLS) enforced at the GraphQL layer. Each table defines insert/select/update/delete permissions per role. Tenant isolation uses RLS policies on `tenant_id` columns.

### Plugin Schema Isolation
Each plugin gets its own PostgreSQL schema (`np_{plugin_name}`) with a dedicated role. Row-level security applies per schema. Zero cross-plugin data leakage by design.

### Tool Gating
nClaw persona `tools_allowed` whitelists restrict which tools each persona can invoke. Shell access requires explicit `NCLAW_ALLOW_SHELL=true`. Browser automation requires user consent (`NClaw_BrowserEnabled` user default).

### Telegram User Gating
`CLAW_TG_ALLOWED_USERS` restricts which Telegram user IDs can interact with the claw bot. Messages from unauthorized users are silently dropped.

## Plugin-to-Plugin Authentication

Internal plugin communication uses shared secrets over the Docker bridge network:

| Secret | Protects |
|--------|----------|
| `PLUGIN_INTERNAL_SECRET` | Generic inter-plugin X-Internal-Token header |
| `MUX_CLAW_SHARED_SECRET` | Mux-to-claw RPC calls (POST /internal/classify) |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_SECRET` | Notify plugin internal API |
| `CLAW_WEB_SECRET` | Claw-web dashboard authentication |

These secrets are auto-generated by `secrets-gen.sh` during `nself init` and stored in `.env.secrets`.

All internal endpoints validate the token before processing. Missing or invalid tokens return 401 (not 500).

## Browser Automation Security

The browser plugin (Playwright/CDP) includes multiple safety layers:

- **SSRF blocking.** All RFC-1918 addresses, private IPs, and localhost are blocked by default.
- **URL allowlist.** `np_claw.browser_allowlist` table controls which domains are accessible.
- **Audit log.** Every browser action is logged to `np_claw.browser_audit_log`.
- **Consent flow.** Browser automation requires explicit user opt-in (`NClaw_BrowserEnabled` user default on macOS).
- **Stealth mode.** `playwright-extra` prevents bot detection on allowed sites.

## Shell Execution Security

The `shell_dispatch_vps` tool (when enabled via `NCLAW_ALLOW_SHELL`) logs every command to `np_claw.shell_audit_log`. Dangerous commands require confirmation via `np_claw.pending_confirmations` with a 2-minute expiry window.

## Email Security

- `CLAW_BLOCKED_RECIPIENTS`: hard blocklist checked before any email pipeline processing.
- Auto-reply guard rails: blocked senders, low-confidence replies, and sensitive topics are escalated to Telegram for manual approval.
- `np_mux_auto_reply_audit` tracks every auto-reply decision (sent, blocked_sender, blocked_confidence, blocked_topic).

## Deferred to v1.1

The following security improvements are planned for a future release:

- Non-root container users for Postgres, Auth, Functions
- Docker socket proxy for Admin service
- Binary signature verification (GPG)
- Automatic ACME certificate renewal
