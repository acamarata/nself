#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Purpose: every [[wiki-link]] in .github/wiki/ must resolve to a page that
#          exists. Broken links are invisible in review and only surface after
#          publish, so they are gated here (CLI-R08).
# Inputs:  none. Operates on .github/wiki/.
# Outputs: exit 0 when every link resolves; exit 1 listing the broken ones.
# Constraints:
#   - GitHub Wiki flattens the namespace, so a page in any subdirectory is
#     reachable by its basename; path-style links are matched on basename too.
#   - Anchors (#section) and a trailing .md are stripped before matching.
#   - Fenced code blocks AND inline `code` spans are skipped: templates and the
#     wiki's own link-audit notes show [[link]] syntax as an example, and
#     GitHub Wiki does not resolve a backtick-enclosed token as a link either.
