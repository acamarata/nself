# Builds the static `nself` CLI from vendored source and ships it on a minimal
# runtime base. Multi-arch: the builder runs natively on the build platform and
# cross-compiles for the target arch (Go honours TARGETOS/TARGETARCH), so we get
# linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 without emulating the toolchain under QEMU.
#
# Consumed by .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml (docker/build-push-action,
# context: .). Build args mirror .goreleaser.yml ldflags so the image is
# identical to the released binaries — including the license public key, without
# which the binary is a "dev build" that skips pro-plugin license verification
# (see internal/license/cache.go IsZeroPubKey).
#
# GO_VERSION must track the `go` directive in go.mod (currently 1.26).

# Runtime: the image IS the CLI. nself shells out to the `docker` client (100+
# call sites, no vendored Docker API client), so backend orchestration needs the
# docker CLI + compose plugin present and the host socket mounted at run time
# (docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock). Runs as root so it
# can reach that socket. Extras: ca-certificates for HTTPS license validation to
# ping.nself.org; git for `nself plugin` installs.
