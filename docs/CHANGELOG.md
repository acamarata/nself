  - Enhanced installation script robustness and professional appearance

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-12

### Added
- **Enhanced Configuration Validation System**
  - 25+ comprehensive validation checks for .env files
  - Automatic detection and fixing of 22+ common configuration issues
  - Empty file handling with automatic minimal config creation
  - Port range validation (1-65535) with conflict detection
  - Special character escaping in passwords
  - Quote mismatch detection and repair
  - Duplicate variable detection and removal
  - Inline comment cleanup for proper parsing

  - 25+ automated fix strategies for common configuration mistakes
  - Safe backup creation before applying fixes
  - Detailed progress reporting during fix application
  - Port conflict resolution with alternative port suggestions
  - Docker naming convention validation and correction
  - Memory format validation (512M, 2G format checking)

- **Professional Output Formatting**
  - Perfect text alignment in all boxed messages and banners
  - Consistent 3-space indentation after border characters

### Changed
- **Environment File Priority System**
  - Strict priority enforcement: `.env` > `.env.local` > `.env.dev`
  - Complete file isolation - no merging between environment files
  - Higher priority files completely override lower priority ones
  - Smart defaults applied only after loading the chosen file

- **Update System**
  - Now pulls exclusively from GitHub releases instead of development branch
  - Ensures users only get stable, tested versions
  - Updated rsync paths to work with new src structure

- **Template Formatting**
  - All `.env.example` and `.env.local` templates updated with perfect alignment
  - Consistent header formatting across all template files
  - Professional appearance suitable for public screenshots

### Fixed
- Empty `.env.local` files causing build failures
- Port numbers >65535 or negative values crashing services
- Leading/trailing whitespace in configuration values
- Quote mismatches breaking configuration parsing
- Special characters in passwords causing shell escaping issues
- Duplicate variables causing undefined behavior
- Inline comments interfering with value parsing
- Invalid IP addresses in host configurations
- Malformed memory specifications causing container issues
- Docker naming violations preventing container creation
- Missing file references breaking SSL configurations
- Mixed case boolean values causing validation failures
- Service list formatting issues with commas and spaces
- Project names with spaces breaking Docker networks
- Weak password detection and automatic replacement
- Environment priority confusion when multiple files exist
- Text alignment issues in all UI components

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive environment configuration guide (`ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md`)
- Updated validation error reference with solutions
- Enhanced troubleshooting documentation
- Auto-fix strategy documentation

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-11

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Major Architecture Refactor**: Moved from monolithic to modular src-centric architecture
  - All implementation code now lives in `/src` with organized subdirectories
  - `/bin` contains only thin shim scripts that delegate to `/src/cli`
  - Templates, certificates, and libraries moved to `/src`
  - Clean separation of concerns with modular error handling and auto-fix systems

### Added
- **Comprehensive Error Handling System** (`/src/lib/errors/`)
  - Modular error detection and reporting
  - Auto-fix capabilities for common issues
  - Interactive user prompts for complex fixes
  - Port conflict resolution with automatic alternative port configuration
  - Docker build error analysis and recovery
  - Go module dependency resolution
  - Node.js build error handling

- **Modular Build System** (`/src/cli/build/`)
  - Broke down 1078-line monolithic build.sh into maintainable modules
  - Separate modules for environment, Docker, services, nginx, SSL, and Hasura
  - Improved error detection and recovery during build process

- **Enhanced Status and Logging** (`/src/cli/status.sh`, `/src/cli/logs.sh`)
  - Real-time service health monitoring
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Improved log filtering and display
  - Progress indicators for long-running operations

- **Doctor Command** (`/src/cli/doctor.sh`)
  - Comprehensive system health checks
  - Environment validation
  - Service connectivity testing
  - Auto-fix suggestions for common issues

### Fixed
- Installation upgrade path from v0.2.x to v0.3.0
- Bash 3.2 compatibility for macOS (removed associative arrays)
- Port conflict detection now uses configured ports from .env.local
- Go module build errors with automatic dependency resolution
- Template path references updated for new src structure
- Safety checks for nself repository detection
- Shebang standardization to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Auto-fix subsystem now uses absolute paths

### Improved
