- Secure with authentication

---

### Script

**[00:00 - 00:45] INTRO**

*Screen: VS Code with empty project*

**Voiceover:**
"In this tutorial, we'll build a complete REST and GraphQL API for a blog application. We'll create database tables, set up relationships, configure permissions, and add authentication - all in about 10 minutes."

*Screen: Show final result - GraphQL Playground with queries*

**Voiceover:**
"By the end, you'll have a production-ready API that supports creating posts, adding comments, user authentication, and fine-grained permissions. Let's get started."

---

**[00:45 - 02:00] DATABASE SCHEMA**

*Screen: Create schema.sql file*

**Voiceover:**
"First, let's design our database schema. We'll create three tables: users, posts, and comments."

*Screen: Type SQL*
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  author_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  post_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES posts(id),
  author_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Voiceover:**
"Notice we're referencing auth.users for the author - that's managed by nself's authentication service. Now let's apply this schema."

*Screen: Terminal*
```bash
nself db execute --file schema.sql
```

*Screen: Show success message*

**Voiceover:**
"Our tables are created. Let's open Hasura and track them."

---

**[02:00 - 03:30] HASURA CONFIGURATION**

**Voiceover:**
"Now let's set up relationships. A post has an author, which is a user. And a post has many comments."

*Screen: Click on posts table, Relationships tab*

**Voiceover:**
"I'll add an object relationship called 'author' pointing to auth.users via author_id."

*Screen: Create relationship*

**Voiceover:**
"And an array relationship called 'comments' from comments table via post_id."

*Screen: Create relationship*

**Voiceover:**
"Perfect. Now our GraphQL schema understands these relationships. Let's test a query."

---

**[03:30 - 05:00] GRAPHQL QUERIES**

*Screen: API tab in Hasura*

**Voiceover:**
"Let's write a query to fetch posts with their authors and comments."

*Screen: Type GraphQL query*
```graphql
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
    author {
      displayName
      email
    }
    comments {
      id
      content
      author {
        displayName
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Voiceover:**
"This query gets posts, includes the author's info, and all comments with their authors. Let's run it."

*Screen: Execute query, show empty result*

**Voiceover:**
"No data yet. Let's add some test data with a mutation."

*Screen: Type mutation*
```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  insert_posts_one(object: {
    title: "My First Post",
    content: "This is the content",
    author_id: "user-uuid-here"
  }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

*Screen: Execute, show success*

**Voiceover:**
"Great! Now if we run our query again..."

*Screen: Re-run GetPosts query*

**Voiceover:**
"We see our post with author information. Our API is working!"

---

**[05:00 - 07:00] PERMISSIONS**

*Screen: Permissions tab*

**Voiceover:**
"Now let's add security. We don't want anonymous users reading everything, and users should only be able to edit their own posts."

*Screen: Click on posts table, Permissions tab*

**Voiceover:**
"For anonymous users, let's allow them to read only published posts."

*Screen: Add row select permission for 'anonymous' role*
```json
{
  "published": {
    "_eq": true
  }
}
```

**Voiceover:**
"And they can only see certain columns - not internal fields."

*Screen: Select columns: id, title, content, created_at*

**Voiceover:**
"For authenticated users, they can read all published posts, but only create, update, and delete their own."

*Screen: Add permissions for 'user' role*

**Insert permission:**
```json
{
  "author_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
  }
}
```

*Screen: Set column preset author_id = X-Hasura-User-Id*

**Update permission:**
```json
{
  "author_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
  }
}
```

**Voiceover:**
"This ensures users can only modify their own posts. The X-Hasura-User-Id comes from the JWT token."

---

**[07:00 - 08:30] TESTING WITH AUTH**

*Screen: Terminal*

**Voiceover:**
"Let's test this with actual authentication. First, I'll create a user."

*Screen: Type curl command*
```bash
curl -X POST http://auth.localhost/signup/email-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
  }'
```

*Screen: Show response with JWT token*

**Voiceover:**
"Perfect. We got a JWT token back. Now let's use this to create a post via the API."

*Screen: Type GraphQL mutation with Authorization header*
```bash
curl -X POST http://api.localhost/v1/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { insert_posts_one(object: {title: \"Authenticated Post\", content: \"Created via API\"}) { id } }"
  }'
```

*Screen: Show success*

**Voiceover:**
"And it works! The post was created with the correct author_id from our JWT token."

---

**[08:30 - 09:30] ADVANCED FEATURES**

*Screen: Back to schema.sql*

**Voiceover:**
"Let's add some advanced features like full-text search and auto-updating timestamps."

*Screen: Add to schema*
```sql
-- Add search column
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

-- Update search vector on changes
CREATE TRIGGER posts_search_update
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON posts
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION
tsvector_update_trigger(search_vector, 'pg_catalog.english', title, content);

-- Create index for fast searching
CREATE INDEX posts_search_idx ON posts USING gin(search_vector);
```

**Voiceover:**
"Now we can search posts efficiently."

*Screen: Hasura Console, create custom function*
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION search_posts(search text)
RETURNS SETOF posts AS $$
  SELECT * FROM posts
  WHERE search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('english', search)
  ORDER BY ts_rank(search_vector, plainto_tsquery('english', search)) DESC;
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

*Screen: Track function in Hasura*

**Voiceover:**
"Track this function in Hasura, and now we can search from GraphQL."

*Screen: Test search query*
```graphql
query SearchPosts {
  search_posts(args: {search: "nself"}) {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

## Video 3: Multi-Tenant Apps Made Easy (15 minutes)

### Target Audience
Developers building SaaS applications who need multi-tenancy.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand multi-tenant architecture
- Implement Row-Level Security
- Create tenant isolation
- Handle tenant switching
- Setup billing per tenant

---

### Script

**[00:00 - 01:00] INTRO**

*Screen: Show popular SaaS apps (Slack, Notion, etc.)*

**Voiceover:**
"What do Slack, Notion, and Asana have in common? They're all multi-tenant applications - one codebase serving thousands of customers with complete data isolation. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build the same architecture using nself, complete with tenant isolation, billing, and team management."

*Screen: Show final demo - switching between tenants*

**Voiceover:**
"By the end, you'll understand how to architect multi-tenant SaaS applications and have a working example you can deploy today. Let's dive in."

---

**[01:00 - 03:00] MULTI-TENANCY EXPLAINED**

*Screen: Architecture diagram*

**Voiceover:**
"First, what is multi-tenancy? Instead of deploying a separate application for each customer, you run one application that serves all customers, with their data completely isolated."

*Screen: Show three isolation approaches*

**Voiceover:**
"There are three common approaches: separate databases, separate schemas, or shared schema with Row-Level Security. We'll use RLS because it's cost-effective and maintainable."

*Screen: Show RLS concept*

**Voiceover:**
"With Row-Level Security, every table has a tenant_id column, and PostgreSQL automatically filters data based on the current user's tenant. Let's implement it."

---

**[03:00 - 05:30] DATABASE SCHEMA**

*Screen: Create multi-tenant schema*

**Voiceover:**
"Our schema needs a tenants table and tenant_users to handle the many-to-many relationship."

*Screen: Show SQL*
```sql
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE tenant_users (
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, user_id)
);
```

**Voiceover:**
"Now every business table includes tenant_id and RLS policies."

*Screen: Show projects table with RLS*
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON projects
  USING (
    tenant_id IN (
      SELECT tenant_id FROM tenant_users
      WHERE user_id = current_setting('hasura.user.id')::UUID
    )
  );
```

**Voiceover:**
"This policy ensures users can only see projects from their tenants. Let's test it."
