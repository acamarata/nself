## Deployment Workflow

When you run `nself deploy <env>`, the following steps are executed:

1. **Local Build** - Runs `nself build` to ensure configs are up-to-date
2. **Create Directories** - Creates remote directory structure
3. **Sync Project Files** - Transfers docker-compose.yml, nginx/, postgres/, services/, monitoring/, ssl/
4. **Sync Environment** - Transfers .env and .env.secrets (merged on server)
5. **Pull Images** - Runs `docker compose pull` on server
6. **Start Services** - Runs `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`
7. **Health Checks** - Verifies services are running

## Files Synced

The deploy command syncs these files/directories:

- `docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions
- `nginx/` - Nginx configs, SSL certs
- `postgres/` - Database init scripts
- `services/` - Custom service code (CS_N)
- `monitoring/` - Prometheus, Grafana configs
- `ssl/certificates/` - SSL certificates
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `.env.secrets` - Sensitive credentials

## Environment Configuration

Environments are configured in `.environments/<name>/`:

```
.environments/
├── staging/
│   ├── .env           # Environment variables
│   ├── .env.secrets   # Sensitive credentials (chmod 600)
│   └── server.json    # SSH connection details
└── prod/
    ├── .env
    ├── .env.secrets
    └── server.json
```

### server.json Format

```json
{
  "host": "your-server.example.com",
  "port": 22,
  "user": "root",
  "key": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
  "deploy_path": "/opt/nself"
}
```

## Service Deployment Scope

### Always Deployed
- **Core Services (4)**: PostgreSQL, Hasura, Auth, Nginx

### Based on *_ENABLED
- **Optional Services (7)**: nself-admin, MinIO, Redis, Functions, MLflow, Mail, Search
- **Monitoring Bundle (10)**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, etc.
- **Custom Services (CS_N)**: User-defined APIs

### Environment-Based
- **Staging**: Deploys everything including frontend apps
- **Production**: Excludes frontend apps (use `--include-frontends` to override)

Frontend apps in production are typically deployed externally (Vercel, Cloudflare, CDN).

## Examples

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Create environment
nself env create staging staging

# Configure server connection
# Edit .environments/staging/server.json

# Deploy
nself deploy staging
```

### Preview Deployment

```bash
nself deploy prod --dry-run
```

Output shows:
- Files that will be synced
- Steps that will be executed
- No changes are made

### Check SSH Access

```bash
# Check access to all environments
nself deploy check-access

# Check specific environment before deploying
nself deploy staging --check-access
```

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

```bash
nself deploy prod --rolling
```

Uses rolling updates to restart services one at a time.

### Deploy Backend Only

```bash
# Exclude frontend apps (default for production)
nself deploy prod --backend-only

# Or explicitly
nself deploy staging --exclude-frontends
```

## Health Checks

After deployment, nself checks:
- Docker services running count
- Nginx status
- Container health states

If health checks fail, services may still be starting. Use:

```bash
nself deploy status
nself deploy logs
nself deploy health prod
```

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:

```bash
nself deploy rollback
```

This resets to the previous git commit and restarts services.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Failed

```bash
# Test connectivity
nself deploy check-access

# Ensure SSH key is added to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@server
```

### Services Not Starting

```bash
# View logs
nself deploy logs

# Check server directly
ssh user@server "cd /opt/nself && docker compose logs"
```

### Nginx Config Errors

The deploy command now:
1. Cleans old nginx configs before regeneration
2. Only generates configs for enabled services
3. Skips frontend configs on Linux servers

If you still have issues, check which services are enabled in your .env.

## Requirements

- SSH access to target server
- Docker and Docker Compose on server
- rsync on local machine (scp used as fallback)
