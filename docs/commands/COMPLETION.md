```bash
eval "$(nself completion bash)"
```

Or save to completions directory:

```bash
nself completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/nself
```

### Zsh

- Options (`--verbose`, `--help`, etc.)
- Service names for relevant commands
- Environment names

nself <TAB>           # Shows all commands
nself db <TAB>        # Shows db subcommands
nself logs <TAB>      # Shows service names
nself --<TAB>         # Shows global options
```

```
