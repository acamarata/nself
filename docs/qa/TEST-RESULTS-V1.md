#### Core File Structure (5 tests) - ✅ 100% PASS
- ✅ Main wrapper (nself.sh) exists
- ✅ Binary (bin/nself) is executable
- ✅ cli-output.sh library exists
- ✅ constants.sh library exists
- ✅ defaults.sh library exists

### 2. Command Routing (20 tests) - ✅ 100% PASS

Tested representative sample of commands via `--help` flag:
- ✅ help, version, init, build, start, stop, status
- ✅ env, config, db, backup, deploy
- ✅ logs, urls, doctor, clean
- ✅ auth, secrets, dev, sync

All commands route correctly to their handlers. No "command not found" errors.

### 3. Help System (3 tests) - ✅ 100% PASS
- ✅ `nself help` returns formatted help text
- ✅ `nself -h` returns formatted help text
- ✅ `nself --help` returns formatted help text

### 4. Version System (3 tests) - ✅ 100% PASS
- ✅ `nself version` returns version information
- ✅ `nself -v` returns short version
- ✅ `nself --version` returns full version info

### 5. Output Formatting (8 tests) - ⚠️ 62% PASS (5/8)

Tests whether commands use cli-output.sh for consistent formatting:
- ⚠️ **init** - Delegates to lib/init/core.sh (by design)
- ⚠️ **build** - Delegates to build modules (by design)
- ✅ **start** - Uses cli-output.sh
- ✅ **stop** - Uses cli-output.sh
- ✅ **deploy** - Uses cli-output.sh
- ✅ **backup** - Uses cli-output.sh
- ⚠️ **env** - Deprecated, redirects to config (by design)
- ✅ **db** - Uses cli-output.sh

**Note:** The 3 warnings are intentional design decisions where commands delegate to specialized modules or are deprecated.

### 6. Subcommand Support (8 tests) - ⚠️ 75% PASS (6/8)

Tests whether commands implement subcommand routing:
- ⚠️ **env** - Deprecated, redirects to config (no case statement needed)
- ✅ **db** - Has case statement for subcommands
- ✅ **backup** - Has case statement for subcommands
- ✅ **config** - Has case statement for subcommands
- ✅ **deploy** - Has case statement for subcommands
- ✅ **auth** - Has case statement for subcommands
- ⚠️ **secrets** - Simple command, no subcommands yet (future enhancement)
- ✅ **service** - Has case statement for subcommands

**Note:** The 2 warnings are for commands that don't need subcommands (env is deprecated, secrets is simple).

### 7. Error Handling (1 test) - ✅ 100% PASS
- ✅ Invalid commands are rejected with helpful error message
- ✅ Suggests running `nself help`
- ✅ Returns non-zero exit code

### 8. Critical Commands (14 tests) - ✅ 100% PASS

All production-essential commands are present:
- ✅ init, build, start, stop, restart
- ✅ status, logs, env, db
- ✅ backup, restore, deploy
- ✅ health, doctor

### 9. Source Repository Protection (1 test) - ✅ 100% PASS
- ✅ nself detects when run in its own source directory
- ✅ Shows clear error message
- ✅ Prevents accidental damage

## Warnings Analysis

All 5 warnings are **non-critical** and **by design**:

### 1. init Output Formatting ⚠️
**Warning:** init.sh doesn't directly import cli-output.sh
**Reason:** Delegates to lib/init/core.sh which has its own comprehensive output handling
**Impact:** None - output formatting is consistent and appropriate
**Action:** No action required

### 2. build Output Formatting ⚠️
**Warning:** build.sh doesn't directly import cli-output.sh
**Reason:** Delegates to specialized build modules with progress tracking
**Impact:** None - build output is detailed and appropriate for the operation
**Action:** No action required

### 3. env Output Formatting ⚠️
**Warning:** env.sh doesn't directly import cli-output.sh
**Reason:** Deprecated command that redirects to config.sh
**Impact:** None - shows deprecation warning, then redirects properly
**Action:** No action required (will be removed in v2.0)

### 4. env Subcommand Case Statement ⚠️
**Warning:** env.sh doesn't have case statement for subcommands
**Reason:** Entire command is deprecated and redirects to `config env`
**Impact:** None - subcommand routing handled by config.sh
**Action:** No action required (will be removed in v2.0)

### 5. secrets Subcommand Case Statement ⚠️
**Warning:** secrets.sh doesn't have case statement
**Reason:** Currently a simple command without subcommands
**Impact:** None - command functions as designed
**Action:** Consider adding subcommands in v1.1 (add, remove, list, rotate, etc.)

## Issues Found During Testing

### Critical Issues
**None found.** ✅

### Non-Critical Issues (All Fixed)

- **Root Cause:** Source repository protection blocking execution
- **Fix:** Modified test to run from temporary directory
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

#### Issue 2: Bash 3.2 Compatibility
- **Problem:** Used `mapfile` command (Bash 4+ only)
- **Root Cause:** Developer oversight
- **Fix:** Replaced with while-read loop
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

#### Issue 3: Variable Scope
- **Problem:** Used `local` outside function context
- **Root Cause:** Script-level variables
- **Fix:** Changed to regular variables
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Source Repository Protection
- Detects multiple indicators of nself source directory
- Shows clear error message
- Prevents accidental damage to nself itself
- Uses belt-and-suspenders approach (multiple checks)

### ✅ Command Injection Prevention
- No eval of user input
- All variables properly quoted
- Input validation on all commands
- shellcheck compliant (error level)

### ✅ File Permission Checks
- Commands check file permissions
- Warns on insecure configurations
- Uses safe_stat_perms() for cross-platform compatibility

### ✅ Secure Defaults
- .gitignore includes sensitive files
- .env files not committed by default
- Secrets properly isolated

---
