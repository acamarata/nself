# Domain Selection Guide for nself Development

## Quick Recommendations

### Best Options for Development

1. **`local.nself.org`** (Recommended)
   - ‚úÖ Automatic wildcard SSL certificate
   - ‚úÖ No /etc/hosts configuration needed
   - ‚úÖ Works immediately out of the box
   - ‚úÖ Resolves to 127.0.0.1 globally
   - Example: `https://api.local.nself.org`, `https://admin.local.nself.org`

2. **`*.localhost`** (Modern browsers)
   - ‚úÖ Auto-resolves in Chrome, Firefox, Edge (no /etc/hosts needed)
   - ‚úÖ SSL certificates set up automatically during build
   - ‚úÖ Clear indication it's local development
   - üîë One-time sudo password during `nself build`
   - Example: `https://api.localhost`, `https://myapp.localhost`

3. **`.test` domains** (Custom but standard)
   - ‚úÖ Reserved TLD for testing (RFC 6761)
   - ‚úÖ /etc/hosts configured automatically during build
   - ‚úÖ SSL certificates set up automatically
   - ‚úÖ Won't conflict with real domains
   - üîë One-time sudo password during `nself build`
   - Example: `https://myapp.test`, `https://api.myapp.test`

4. **Port-based localhost** (Simplest, no subdomains)
   - ‚úÖ Works everywhere immediately
   - ‚ùå No subdomain support
   - ‚ùå Services on different ports
   - Example: `http://localhost:8080`, `http://localhost:3005`

## Domains to Avoid

### Never Use These

- **`.local`** - Reserved for mDNS/Bonjour, causes conflicts on macOS/Linux
- **`.dev`** - Real TLD with forced HTTPS (HSTS), won't work locally
- **`.app`** - Real TLD with forced HTTPS (HSTS), won't work locally
- **`.io`, `.com`, `.org`** - Real TLDs, could conflict with actual sites

## SSL/TLS Certificates - Fully Automated!

### üéâ Good news: nself handles everything automatically!

During `nself build`, we automatically:
1. Install mkcert if needed (via brew)
2. Set up the local certificate authority
3. Generate wildcard SSL certificates
4. Configure nginx to use HTTPS

**The only thing you might see:** A one-time sudo password prompt to trust the certificates.

### Certificate Setup by Domain Type

| Domain Type | SSL Setup | User Action Required |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `local.nself.org` | Pre-configured wildcard cert | None |
| `*.localhost` | Auto-generated during build | One-time sudo password |
| `.test` domains | Auto-generated during build | One-time sudo password |
| Custom domains | Auto-generated during build | One-time sudo password |

### What happens during `nself build`:

```bash
$ nself build
‚úì Checking environment...
‚úì Installing mkcert... (if needed)
‚úì Setting up certificate authority... (may ask for sudo password once)
‚úì Generating SSL certificates...
‚úì Configuring nginx...
‚úì Build complete!
```

That's it! Your services will be available via HTTPS automatically.

## Browser Support

### Automatic Resolution (No /etc/hosts needed)

| Domain | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Edge |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|------|
| `localhost` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `*.localhost` | ‚úÖ v89+ | ‚úÖ v90+ | ‚úÖ v15+ | ‚úÖ |
| `local.nself.org` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `.test` domains | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

## /etc/hosts Configuration

### ü§ñ Automated Setup

nself automatically handles /etc/hosts during `nself build`:
- Detects which domains need entries
- Prompts once for sudo to add them
- Updates are non-destructive (preserves existing entries)

### What gets added (example for `.test` domains):

```bash
# nself entries (added automatically)
127.0.0.1 myapp.test
127.0.0.1 api.myapp.test
127.0.0.1 hasura.myapp.test
127.0.0.1 admin.myapp.test
127.0.0.1 storage.myapp.test
```

**Note:** For `localhost` and `local.nself.org`, no /etc/hosts changes are needed!

## Wizard Domain Flow

The nself wizard now offers these options:

1. **local.nself.org** - Zero configuration, just works
2. **localhost with subdomains** - Modern browser support, optional mkcert
3. **Custom domain** - Full control, requires setup
4. **Port-based localhost** - No subdomains, different ports

## Wizard Selection

The nself wizard keeps it simple with just three options:

1. **local.nself.org (recommended)** - Press enter and it works
2. **localhost** - Universal fallback option
3. **Custom prefix** - Add your project name

## Migration Guide

### From `.local` domains
```bash
# Old (problematic)
BASE_DOMAIN=myapp.local

# New (recommended)
BASE_DOMAIN=myapp.test        # Custom with /etc/hosts
BASE_DOMAIN=myapp.localhost   # Auto-resolves in modern browsers
BASE_DOMAIN=local.nself.org   # Zero configuration
```

### Adding SSL to existing setup

Just run `nself build` again! It will:
1. Detect your current domain configuration
2. Install mkcert if needed
3. Generate appropriate certificates
4. Update nginx configuration
5. You'll only be asked for sudo password once

```bash
$ nself build
# Automatically handles everything!
```

### Manual SSL setup (optional, for advanced users)

If you prefer to set up certificates manually:
```bash
# nself build will detect and use these
mkdir -p .certs
cd .certs
mkcert -cert-file localhost.crt -key-file localhost.key localhost *.localhost
```
