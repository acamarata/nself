# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the nself community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* **Be helpful** and provide constructive feedback
* **Be patient** with those learning or asking questions

## Project-Specific Standards

### Technical Standards

* **Follow cross-platform compatibility rules** - Bash 3.2+, POSIX compliance (see [CROSS-PLATFORM-COMPATIBILITY.md](CROSS-PLATFORM-COMPATIBILITY.md))
* **Test your code** before submitting - ensure all CI tests pass
* **Document your changes** - update relevant documentation
* **Keep code quality high** - follow existing patterns and standards
* **No hallucinations** - only document and implement what actually exists or is explicitly planned

### Communication Standards

* **Use clear, concise English** in code, comments, and documentation
* **Be specific** when reporting issues or requesting features
* **Provide context** - include environment details, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
* **Search before posting** - check if your question has been answered
* **Stay on topic** - use appropriate channels (Issues, Discussions, PRs)

### Infrastructure Standards

We're building infrastructure tools that people depend on. This means:

* **Reliability is paramount** - test thoroughly, especially for destructive operations
* **Security matters** - never commit secrets, follow security best practices
* **Performance counts** - be mindful of resource usage and startup time
* **Compatibility is critical** - support multiple platforms and environments

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Code and documentation
* Project communication channels
* Events and meetings (virtual or in-person)
* Public representation of the project

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at:

* **Email**: Contact via GitHub profile
* **GitHub**: Use the "Report abuse" feature on specific content
* **Private Issues**: For sensitive matters, contact maintainers directly

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## AI Agent Guidelines

### For AI Agents Contributing to nself

AI agents (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and others) are welcome to contribute to nself, but must follow these additional guidelines:

1. **Verify accuracy** - Do not hallucinate features, commands, or configurations
2. **Follow compatibility rules** - Always adhere to cross-platform compatibility standards
3. **Test before committing** - Ensure code passes all CI tests
4. **Document clearly** - Indicate AI-generated content when relevant
5. **Learn from feedback** - Incorporate corrections and follow project standards
6. **Read documentation** - Reference project documentation and [CROSS-PLATFORM-COMPATIBILITY.md](CROSS-PLATFORM-COMPATIBILITY.md)

### For Developers Using AI Agents

When using AI agents to contribute:

1. **Review all AI-generated code** thoroughly before submitting
2. **Test AI-generated changes** - don't blindly trust output
3. **Verify compatibility** - ensure AI followed cross-platform rules
4. **Take responsibility** - you're accountable for your submissions
5. **Provide feedback** - correct AI mistakes and reinforce good patterns
