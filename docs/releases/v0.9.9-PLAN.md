# nself v0.9.9 - QA & Final Testing

**Target**: Late February 2026 (2-3 weeks after v0.9.8)
**Focus**: Quality assurance, bug fixes, and final polish before v1.0 LTS
**Goal**: Production-proven stability with zero critical bugs

---

## Overview

v0.9.9 is the **final release before v1.0 LTS** - a pure QA and stabilization release with:
- **No new features** - Feature freeze in effect
- **Bug fixes only** - Address all reported issues
- **Performance tuning** - Optimize based on v0.9.8 feedback
- **Documentation polish** - Fix errors, improve clarity
- **Final testing** - Comprehensive QA across all platforms

**After v0.9.9** → v1.0.0 LTS (stable API, long-term support)

---

## Key Principles

### Feature Freeze

### What IS Allowed
- ✅ Bug fixes (crashes, data corruption, security issues)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (no behavior changes)
- ✅ Documentation improvements (clarity, examples, corrections)
- ✅ Error message improvements (UX only)
- ✅ Test coverage improvements (no logic changes)
- ✅ CI/CD improvements (build process, test reliability)

### What is NOT Allowed
- ❌ New features or capabilities
- ❌ New commands or subcommands
- ❌ Breaking changes to APIs
- ❌ Dependency upgrades (unless critical security fix)
