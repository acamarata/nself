## 🐛 Known Issues

Minor issues that don't affect production use:

1. **Integration tests**: Some integration tests fail in CI environments (macOS `timeout` command not available). Core functionality is unaffected.
2. **Homebrew formula**: SHA256 will be updated after release publication.

These issues will be addressed in v0.5.1 patch release.
