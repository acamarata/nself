# v0.3.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 11, 2025

Major architecture refactor - the foundation for modern nself.

---

## Overview

v0.3.0 represents a **breaking change** with a complete architectural overhaul, moving from a monolithic structure to a modular, maintainable src-centric architecture.

---

## Breaking Changes

- **Major Architecture Refactor**: All implementation code now lives in `/src` with organized subdirectories
- `/bin` contains only thin shim scripts that delegate to `/src/cli`
- Templates, certificates, and libraries moved to `/src`
- Clean separation of concerns with modular error handling and auto-fix systems

---

## Features

### Added

#### Comprehensive Error Handling System (`/src/lib/errors/`)
- Modular error detection and reporting
- Auto-fix capabilities for common issues
- Interactive user prompts for complex fixes
- Port conflict resolution with automatic alternative port configuration
- Docker build error analysis and recovery
- Go module dependency resolution
- Node.js build error handling

#### Modular Build System (`/src/cli/build/`)
- Broke down 1078-line monolithic build.sh into maintainable modules
- Separate modules for environment, Docker, services, nginx, SSL, and Hasura
- Improved error detection and recovery during build process

#### Enhanced Status and Logging
- Real-time service health monitoring
- Color-coded status indicators
- Improved log filtering and display
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

#### Doctor Command (`/src/cli/doctor.sh`)
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Environment validation
- Service connectivity testing
- Auto-fix suggestions for common issues

### Fixed
- Installation upgrade path from v0.2.x to v0.3.0
- Bash 3.2 compatibility for macOS (removed associative arrays)
- Port conflict detection now uses configured ports from .env.local
- Go module build errors with automatic dependency resolution
- Template path references updated for new src structure
- Safety checks for nself repository detection
- Shebang standardization to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Auto-fix subsystem now uses absolute paths

### Improved
- Performance optimizations for quick checks
- Docker Desktop auto-start on macOS
- Interactive menus for complex configuration choices
- Error messages are more descriptive and actionable
- Build process is more resilient to failures
- Version detection now properly reads from /src/VERSION

---

## Upgrade Notes

Users upgrading from v0.2.x should:
1. Back up their `.env` files
2. Run `nself update`
3. Run `nself build` to regenerate configurations
