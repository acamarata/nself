// root_repo_scoped_test.go — Guards the repo-scoped command exemption.
//
// Purpose: `nself ci` operates on a source checkout, not a running stack, so it
//          must be exempt from the monorepo redirect and the source-repo guard.
//          Lifecycle commands must NOT be exempt — that redirect is why `stop`,
//          `logs` and `status` work from a monorepo root.
// Inputs:  command names.
// Outputs: assertions on isRepoScopedCommand / isSourceSafeCommand.
// Constraints: pure predicate tests; no filesystem, no chdir, no Docker.
//
// The bug this pins: PersistentPreRunE chdir'd into the detected backend/
// before RunE, so `nself ci --check .` resolved "." against backend/ rather
// than the directory the user typed it in. From inside ntask it announced
// "Using backend as project root" and failed, because backend/ has no manifest
// while the repo root has package.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml. It overrode an
// explicitly passed path, which is what made it a correctness bug.

// monorepo chdir. Adding a name here is a deliberate act: it means the command
// takes a repo path and must see the user's cwd.
