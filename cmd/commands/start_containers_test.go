// Purpose: Regression coverage for P6 FIX-CLI-2 (found 2026-09-03) — `nself
// start`'s "Starting PostgreSQL" step ran `docker compose up -d postgres`
// unconditionally on every invocation, even when a healthy postgres
// container for the project was already running. Compose's own config-hash
// diff normally makes that a no-op, but an on-disk docker-compose.yml that
// drifted from what actually created the running container (regenerated
// elsewhere, .env edited since the last `nself build`, etc.) makes Compose
// treat it as a config change and attempt to recreate an already-healthy
// postgres — which can fail mid-recreate. `nself start` run a second time
// against a live, healthy stack hit exactly this; `docker compose up` (no
// service filter) succeeded immediately after as a manual workaround.
// startPostgresPhase (start_containers.go) now checks
// docker.GetHealthStatus for the project's postgres container before
// calling ComposeUp, and skips the compose-up call entirely when it is
// already "healthy". postgresAlreadyRunning is the pure decision predicate
// behind that guard.
// Inputs: none (pure string-in/bool-out).
// Outputs: pass/fail via testing.T.
// Constraints: table-driven per every internal/docker.GetHealthStatus return
//              value ("healthy", "unhealthy", "starting", "none",
//              "not_found") plus an empty string for the zero value.
