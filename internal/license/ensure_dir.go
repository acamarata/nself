// Making the license directory usable when an older layout left a file there.
//
// Purpose: license paths under $HOME are created with MkdirAll. An older nSelf
// stored the license as a regular FILE at $HOME/.nself/license, with no
// extension. MkdirAll against that path returns ENOTDIR, so on an upgraded
// machine every license operation failed with a message naming neither the
// cause nor the fix:
//
//	Error: setting license key: remove /Users/<u>/.nself/license/key: not a directory
//
// MigrateLicenseFromV1 handles the separate `license.json` case and does not
// apply here.
//
// Inputs: a directory a caller is about to create.
//
// Outputs: nil once the path exists as a directory.
//
// Constraints: the migration is deliberately narrow. It fires ONLY for the
// license directory itself, because that is the one path a known older layout
// occupied with a file. Callers pass other directories here too, including
// $HOME/.nself, and silently renaming whatever sits at an arbitrary path would
// be far more destructive than the bug it fixes. Anything else that is not a
// directory is reported, not moved. The legacy file is never deleted: it is
// the user's license and may be the only copy.

// ensureDir creates dir. If the known legacy license file occupies the path it
// is moved aside first; any other non-directory is an error.
