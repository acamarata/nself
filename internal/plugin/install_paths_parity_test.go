// TestInstallAndRemovePathsShareTheirSteps guards a class of bug rather than an
// instance.
//
// There are two install paths — installLocked for registry plugins and
// installFromURL for third-party ones — and they had drifted. Two fixes made to
// the registry path were never made to the other:
//
//   - publishing the command binary, so a third-party CLI plugin installed
//     cleanly and its command did not exist;
//   - skipping schema creation for a plugin with no tables, so installing a
//     command-line plugin needed Docker and a running Postgres.
//
// Both were found by installing a third-party plugin end to end, months after
// the registry path was fixed. Nothing pointed at the second path.
//
// This asserts the steps that must exist in both. It is deliberately a
// source-level check: the two functions do genuinely different things and
// cannot be collapsed into one, so the only thing worth pinning is that neither
// forgets a step the other performs.

	required := []string{
		"linkCLIBinary",    // publish the command, or the plugin installs dead
		"pluginOwnsTables", // do not demand a database from a plugin with no tables

	// Remove is the third path, and it had drifted the same way: it never
	// unpublished the command binary and demanded a database from a plugin with
	// no tables. What each path must do differs, so the requirements are
	// per-path rather than one shared list.
