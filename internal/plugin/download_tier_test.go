// download_tier_test.go — Regression coverage for the paid-plugin download
// routing fix (qa/bugs/plugin-distribution-broken.md).
//
// Purpose: prove that tier routing comes from the registry manifest and not
//          from the hand-maintained paidPlugins name map. The shipped bug was
//          that 68 of the 127 registered paid plugins are absent from that map,
//          so every one of them was routed down the FREE download path
//          (plugins.nself.org tarball + GitHub Releases fallback) and 404'd,
//          because they were never published as free releases.
// Inputs:  plugin names, versions, repository URLs, manifest tier fields.
// Outputs: assertions on the URL chosen and on the manifest tier predicate.
// Constraints: pure string construction — no network, no filesystem.

// TestIsPaidPluginManifest_UsesRegistryFieldsNotNameMap is the negative test the
