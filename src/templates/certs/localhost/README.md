# localhost SSL Certificates

This directory contains mkcert-generated certificates for localhost domains.

## Files (generated at runtime):
- `fullchain.pem` - Certificate chain for localhost, *.localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1
- `privkey.pem` - Private key
- `cert.pem` - Certificate only (if needed separately)

## Important:
- These files are generated by `nself ssl bootstrap`
- Do NOT commit certificates or private keys to git
- Certificates are created using mkcert for local trust

## Usage:
1. Run `nself ssl bootstrap` to generate certificates
2. Run `nself trust` to install the root CA in your system
3. Certificates will be copied to your project's `nginx/ssl/localhost/` directory
