# *.local.nself.org SSL Certificates

This directory contains certificates for the *.local.nself.org domain.

## Files (generated at runtime):
- `fullchain.pem` - Certificate chain for *.local.nself.org
- `privkey.pem` - Private key
- `cert.pem` - Certificate only (if needed separately)
- `wildcard.pfx` - PKCS12 bundle for Windows import (optional)
- `pfx-pass.txt` - Password for PFX file (if applicable)

## Certificate Types:
1. **Public Wildcard (preferred)**: Let's Encrypt certificate via DNS-01 challenge
   - Requires DNS provider API credentials
   - Globally trusted, no local CA installation needed
   
2. **Internal Certificate (fallback)**: mkcert-generated for local trust
   - Used when DNS credentials are not available
   - Requires `nself trust` to install root CA

## Important:
- These files are generated by `nself ssl bootstrap`
- Do NOT commit certificates or private keys to git
- Public certificates auto-renew with `nself ssl renew`

## Usage:
1. Set DNS provider credentials in `.env.local` (for public wildcard)
2. Run `nself ssl bootstrap` to generate certificates
3. Run `nself trust` if using internal certificates
4. Certificates will be copied to your project's `nginx/ssl/nself-org/` directory
