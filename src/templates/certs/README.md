# Development SSL Certificates

## Security Notice

**These certificates are intentionally committed to the repository.**

These are **self-signed development certificates** generated by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local development purposes only. They are:

- **NOT** production certificates
- **NOT** trusted by any public Certificate Authority
- **NOT** usable for any real-world attacks
- **ONLY** valid for localhost and local.nself.org domains

## Why They're Included

1. **Zero-config local HTTPS**: Developers can start with HTTPS immediately without generating certificates
2. **Consistent development**: All team members have the same certificates
3. **CI/CD testing**: Automated tests can use HTTPS without certificate generation

## Certificate Details

| Directory | Domain | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `localhost/` | localhost, 127.0.0.1 | Local development |
| `nself-org/` | *.local.nself.org | Local domain routing |
| `self-signed/` | Generic fallback | Default certificates |

## For Production

**Never use these certificates in production.**

For production, use:
- `nself ssl` command to generate Let's Encrypt certificates
- Your own certificates from a trusted CA

## Regenerating Certificates

To generate your own development certificates:

```bash
# Install mkcert
brew install mkcert  # macOS
# or
apt install mkcert   # Linux

# Generate new certificates
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

## GitGuardian Notice

If you receive a GitGuardian alert about "Generic Private Key exposed", this is a **false positive**. These development certificates are intentionally public and pose no security risk.
