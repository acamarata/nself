**Release Date**: August 15, 2025

Complete SSL/HTTPS support for development and production.

---

## Overview

This release delivers full HTTPS implementation, achieving 100% service success rate with proper SSL certificates.

---

## Features

### Added

#### Complete SSL/HTTPS Support
- Automatic SSL certificate generation using mkcert for development environments
- Support for both `*.localhost` and `*.local.nself.org` domain patterns
- Wildcard SSL certificates with proper Subject Alternative Name (SAN) configuration
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect for all services
- Modern TLS configuration with secure cipher suites and protocols

#### SSL Certificate Management
- `nself trust` command to install SSL certificates in system trust store
- Automatic certificate generation during build process
- Domain-specific certificate selection (localhost vs nself.org patterns)
- Certificate validation and health checking
- Browser-ready green lock compatibility

#### Enhanced Service Architecture
- **100% service success rate** (17/17 services running reliably)
- Improved volume mount strategy preserving node_modules and dependencies
- Reserved port allocation (3000-3099 for user apps, 3100+ for services)
- Enhanced service health monitoring and auto-recovery

### Fixed

#### Critical Volume Mount Issues
- Node.js services now preserve installed dependencies during development
- Changed volume mounts from entire directories to source-only mounting
- Resolved "Cannot find module" errors in NestJS, BullMQ, and Functions services

#### SSL and Nginx Configuration
- Fixed nginx upstream definition conflicts causing restart loops
- Resolved SSL certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) configuration
- Fixed dynamic nginx includes with static configuration approach
- Corrected certificate path references in nginx configurations

#### Service Reliability
- Docker health checks now work without 'which' command dependency
- Eliminated port allocation conflicts between user and system services
- Fixed service startup reliability from 76% to 100% success rate
- Resolved container restart loops and networking issues

### Changed
- Default HTTPS everywhere: All services now use HTTPS by default in development
- Smart port allocation: System services moved to 3100+ range
- Volume mount strategy: Source-only mounting preserves container dependencies
- SSL trust integration: Certificates automatically trusted during build process
