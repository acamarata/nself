## Overview

The `nself logs` command provides access to container logs with clean formatting, color coding, and filtering options. It supports real-time streaming, multi-service aggregation, and various output formats.

---

## Basic Usage

# View all service logs
nself logs

# Follow logs in real-time
nself logs -f
nself logs --follow

# View specific service logs
nself logs postgres
nself logs hasura

# Last N lines
nself logs --tail 100

```

---

## Service Selection

# By category
nself logs --required    # Core services only
nself logs --optional    # Optional services
nself logs --monitoring  # Monitoring stack
nself logs --custom      # Custom services (CS_N)
```

## Filtering Options

### Time-Based

```bash
# Since specific time
nself logs --since 1h
nself logs --since 30m
nself logs --since "2024-01-20 10:00:00"

# Until specific time
nself logs --until 5m
```

### Content-Based

```bash
# Grep for pattern
nself logs | grep "error"
nself logs --grep "connection refused"

# Exclude patterns (quiet mode)

```

---

## Log Levels

Logs are color-coded by level:

|-------|-------|---------|
| ERROR | Red | Connection refused |
| WARN | Yellow | Deprecated feature |
| INFO | Blue | Server started |
| DEBUG | Gray | Query executed |

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Logs Appearing

```bash
# Check if containers are running
nself status

# Check Docker logs directly
docker compose logs
```

### Logs Too Verbose

```bash
# Use quiet mode
nself logs --quiet

# Filter specific service
nself logs postgres --tail 20
```

### Missing Timestamps

```bash
# Force timestamps
nself logs -t
```
