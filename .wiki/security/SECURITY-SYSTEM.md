## Usage Examples

### Enable Security for a Project

1. **Run the migration:**
   ```bash
   nself migrate run 014_create_security_system.sql
   ```

2. **Scan for vulnerabilities:**
   ```bash
   nself security scan
   ```

3. **Enable MFA for users:**
   ```bash
   nself security mfa enable --method=totp --user=<user_id>
   ```

4. **Monitor security events:**
   ```bash
   nself security events
   ```

### Respond to Security Incident

1. **Detect incident:**
   ```bash
   nself security scan suspicious
   ```

2. **Review incident:**
   ```bash
   nself security incidents list
   nself security incidents show <incident_id>
   ```

3. **Take action:**
   ```bash
   # Lock compromised account
   # (would be done through API)

   # Block malicious IP
   # (would be done through API)

   # Revoke sessions
   # (would be done through API)
   ```

4. **Resolve incident:**
   ```bash
   nself security incidents resolve <incident_id> "Incident resolved, user notified"
   ```

### Monitor Device Security

```bash
# List devices for user
nself security devices list <user_id>

# Trust known devices
nself security devices trust <device_id>

# Remove suspicious devices
nself security devices remove <device_id>
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Self-Hosted Users

1. **Enable MFA for all admin accounts**
   - Use TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
   - Add hardware keys (YubiKey) for critical accounts
   - Generate backup codes

2. **Monitor security events regularly**
   - Check for suspicious activity daily
   - Review open incidents weekly
   - Investigate high-risk events immediately

3. **Implement password policies**
   - Enforce strong passwords
   - Require password changes every 90 days
   - Prevent password reuse (last 5 passwords)

4. **Trust user devices**
   - Review devices monthly
   - Remove inactive devices
   - Trust only known devices

5. **Enable automated responses**
   - Configure incident response playbooks
   - Set up alerting (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
   - Automate account locking for brute force

### For Production Deployments

1. **Hardware Security Keys**
   - Require hardware keys for admin access
   - Support multiple keys per user (backup)
   - Use FIPS-certified keys for compliance

2. **Security Monitoring**
   - Set up Prometheus alerts for security events
   - Use Grafana dashboards for visualization
   - Export security events to SIEM

3. **Incident Response**
   - Define incident severity levels
   - Create escalation procedures
   - Conduct post-incident reviews
   - Document lessons learned

4. **Compliance**
   - Regular security audits
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Access reviews

## API Integration

Security features are exposed through Hasura GraphQL:

```graphql
# Query security events
query GetSecurityEvents($userId: uuid!) {
  auth_security_events(
    where: { user_id: { _eq: $userId } }
    order_by: { created_at: desc }
    limit: 50
  ) {
    id
    event_type
    severity
    description
    is_suspicious
    risk_score
    created_at
  }
}

# Query user devices
query GetUserDevices($userId: uuid!) {
  auth_user_devices(
    where: { user_id: { _eq: $userId } }
    order_by: { last_seen_at: desc }
  ) {
    id
    device_name
    device_type
    is_trusted
    risk_score
    last_seen_at
  }
}

# Query WebAuthn credentials
query GetWebAuthnKeys($userId: uuid!) {
  auth_webauthn_credentials(
    where: { user_id: { _eq: $userId } }
    order_by: { created_at: desc }
  ) {
    id
    name
    credential_type
    authenticator_attachment
    created_at
    last_used_at
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Event Flow

```
User Action → Application → Security Event Logger
                               ↓
                    Security Event Table
                               ↓
                    Suspicious Activity Detector
                               ↓
                         Incident Creator
                               ↓
                    Automated Response Playbook
                               ↓
                    Resolution & Metrics
```

### Device Tracking Flow

```
User Login → Device Fingerprint → Device Lookup
                                      ↓
                              New Device?
                              ↓         ↓
                            Yes        No
                             ↓          ↓
                   Create Device    Update Last Seen
                             ↓          ↓
                   Calculate Risk Score
                             ↓
                   Log Security Event
                             ↓
                   Check If Suspicious
                             ↓
                   Create Incident If Needed
```

### WebAuthn Flow

```
Registration:
User → Generate Challenge → Frontend Creates Credential
       ↓
    Store Public Key & Counter
       ↓
    Mark As Enrolled

Authentication:
User → Generate Challenge → Frontend Signs Challenge
       ↓
    Verify Signature
       ↓
    Check Counter (anti-replay)
       ↓
    Update Counter
       ↓
    Log Security Event
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing
- All foreign keys are indexed
- Time-series queries optimized (created_at DESC)
- Risk score queries indexed
- Suspicious activity filtered with partial index

### Partitioning (Optional)
- Security events can be partitioned by month
- Metrics table can be partitioned by day
- Improves query performance for large datasets

### Retention
- Consider archiving old security events (>1 year)
- Keep incident records indefinitely (compliance)
- Rotate security metrics based on policy

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Create test user
nself auth signup --email=test@example.com --password=test123

# Enable MFA
nself security mfa enable --method=totp --user=<user_id>

# Simulate brute force (would trigger incident)
# Multiple failed logins

# View security events
nself security events <user_id>

# Check incidents
nself security incidents list
```

### Integration Testing

Security features integrate with:
- Authentication system (auth.sh, mfa.sh)
- Rate limiting (rate-limit.sh)
- Session management
- Hasura GraphQL
- PostgreSQL RLS

## Troubleshooting

### Security Events Not Logging
- Check PostgreSQL connection
- Verify auth schema exists
- Check RLS policies
- Verify user permissions

### WebAuthn Not Working
- Ensure HTTPS (required for WebAuthn)
- Check browser compatibility
- Verify RP ID matches domain
- Check credential storage

### Incidents Not Creating
- Check suspicious activity detection
- Verify incident table exists
- Check detection thresholds
- Review security event logs
